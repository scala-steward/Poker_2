   * Given a set of 5 playing card identifiers such as 2H, 7C, QS, 10D, 2D;
   * determine if this hand is better than some other hand, according to the rules of poker.
   *
   * Hands will be a string with 5 cards comma separated,
   * each card will have 1-2 digits or JQKA and a suit indicator C,D,S,H (i.e. 10C, KH)
   *
   * Possible Hand Types Below:
   *   Straight flush
   *   Four of a kind
   *   Full house
   *   Flush
   *   Straight
   *   Three of a kind
   *   Two pair
   *   One pair
   *
   * The goal of this is to compare between the hand types.
   * Comparing 2 of the same type (i.e. 2 straights) to determine a winner is outside the scope
   * and will not be tested.
   *
   * Implement hand1WinsOverHand2 method and return whether or not the first hand wins over the second hand.
